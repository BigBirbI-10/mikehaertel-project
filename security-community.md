## Non-Traditional Developer Profile

### Self-Assessment
"As a guy that isn't a software engineer" - demonstrates:
- **Humility**: Realistic self-assessment of skill level
- **Growth mindset**: Actively learning and building despite non-traditional background
- **Tool leverage**: Using modern AI coding tools (Claude, Cursor, Antigravity) to compensate for experience gaps
- **Practical focus**: Building functional tools rather than perfect code
- **Community contribution**: Publishing open-source work despite imposter syndrome

### Modern Development Approach
- Leveraging AI pair programming tools as learning aids
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Learning by building real projects
- Open-source contribution and community engagement
- GitHub as portfolio and collaboration platform

## Skills Progression

This work demonstrates evolution from traditional infrastructure/operations background into modern development:
- **Traditional**: System administration, infrastructure management
- **Transition**: Shell scripting, automation, tool development
- **Modern**: GitHub workflows, AI-assisted development, open-source contribution
- **Future**: Continuing to build technical skills through practical projects

## Value Proposition

The combination of:
- **Infrastructure expertise** (15+ years enterprise IT)
- **Security awareness** (Hak5 community, DEF CON exposure)
- **Modern development tools** (AI-assisted coding, GitHub)
- **Practical problem-solving** (building tools that solve real needs)

Creates a unique profile: experienced infrastructure professional who can rapidly develop solutions using modern tools and maintain security awareness through community involvement.
